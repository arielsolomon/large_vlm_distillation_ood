How to prepare object detection data for distilation:


create several folders:
0_car
1_dog
2_humans
ect'

each image in folder should contain the name vehicle or no_vehicle and some index and jpg (easier for our case)

train txt shold look like: 
	
	train/car/car_8983.jpg
	train/dog/dog_8985.jpg
	train/humans/humans_8986.jpg


label2text should look like:

	0_car 0 0_car
	1_dog 1 1_dog
	2_humans 1 1_humans
	
I should also prepare corrupted data
